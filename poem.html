 <h1 style="color:#ff6699 ; font-size:100px"> Poem : I am still dance !</h1>
<p>I am still dance</p>
<p>I can see you watching me</p>
<p>How hypnotized you become watching my tree trunk legs</p>
<p>Spin</p>
<p>And spin </p>
<p>Until you see roots of childhood insults</p>
<p>And the distorted voices trying to whisper hurtful things</p>
<p>I swear i heard your voice too</p>
<p>But Don’t you know?</p>
<p>I am too stubborn</p>
<p>Too proud of tree trunk legs making rings out of spins</p>
<p>How I am sun</p>
<p>Be careful not to get burned from this passionate round</p>
<p>Be careful not to blind yourself with my bright eyes </p>
<p>Round and filled with wonder</p>
<p>Like how you are so transfixed with how my body moves</p>
<p>Don’t you know trees sway too?</p>
<p>That sun bodies can make heat wave?</p>
<p>That my hips are a river that keeps flowing and swaying </p>
<p>To a tempo you can only dream of flowing along to</p>
<p>I see you amused </p>
<p>Looking at me like I’m crazy</p>
<p>How dare me dance with my round </p>
<p>Love this sun shaped body</p>
<p>And tree trunk legs</p>
<p>But sweetie I am mother nature</p>
<p>My body is made up of the most beautiful things</p>
<p>And you are just a visitor 
<p>A guest hypnotized by my sway</p>
<p>By my round</p>
<p>By stomps and kicks </p>
<p>You can never keep up with</p>
<p>DOn’t you know?</p>
<p>When i first heard your distorted whisper</p>
<p>Caress my ear with a message that rolled off your axe tongue</p>
<p>My tree trunk legs only spun faster</p>
<p>Not caring about distorted whispers and axe tongues</p>
<p>Don’t you know?</p>
<p>No matter how many voices try to tell me no</p>
<p>I am still mother nature</p>
<p>I am still dance</p>
<p>And this round still transfixes you </p>
<p>With beauty and a sway only you</p>
<p>Can dream to sway to</p>
