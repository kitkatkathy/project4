<p> "Just be who you are. Accept yourself and accept others and live," answered Collin Kirdahy.</p></center>
<center><p>Dressed in a black leotard, Kirdahy wore some pink lipstick and eye makeup. From what we have learned Kirdahy is the first male student in the school's history to dance on pointe. Kirdahy has had a passion for ballet from about the age of six.

“Actually went and saw ‘Black Swan’, which was near and dear to my heart and I just remember after the show I was like ‘mom can I have that Ballerina Barbie. She said ‘absolutely’ – let’s get that,” explained Kirdahy. I’m home for the next three years playing with this Barbie. Ever since then I have looked at it as such an art and such a beautiful quality that a dancer could have.”

Kirdahy is a transfer student from SUNY Potsdam feeling the school wasn’t a 'suitable fit' for him.

“I feel like at Postdam, because of its rural aspect and how secluded it was, it was very closed-minded, whereas here, it’s a smaller New York City, so it’s more opened and more accepting and more allowing of differences,” said Kirdahy.  </p></center>
