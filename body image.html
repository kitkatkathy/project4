<center><p>Akira Armstrong is the founder of PRETTY BIG MOVEMENT which is a dance company for plus size women. She had a difficult time growing up as a dancer because many people judge her based on her size.” When people think about the stereotypical dancer's body, they think [of someone] very thin, tall, long legs, long arms," Armstrong said.” Growing up in a dance environment, I did feel like my body was a negative [thing]," she said. I couldn't fit [into] costumes, and my costume was always different from everyone else's." Akia Armstrong flew to LA to open up her own dance company for full figured women [ PRETTY BIG MOVEMENT]. She made womens audition and there she found her group of girls. When she performs with her group, she said she wants people to be inspire and also show that they are amazing and anyone could do it.  It looks as though Armstrong's work is already plenty inspiring — as one Facebook user commented on her video above. "Women of all shapes and sizes should be represented on television. I want to see more from them."
Which I totally agree !</p></center>
