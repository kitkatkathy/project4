He was offered a place at The Washington Ballet in 2008 which is considered a high status dance company. He also won awards at the Boston and Cape town International Ballet competitions as well as playing attracting roles across the world. 
Andile Ndlovu - 
 "What I wanted was to change people's minds in South Africa about black ballet dancers. I wanted to change that view, because everybody used to put it in a category for the elite people or, you know, it's only for a certain racial group” ."I [want to] set the bar for anybody else that's coming, that's growing up, that's coming behind, and they will learn from my actions and what I do and hopefully I become a role model for them, especially South Africans," he adds.</p></center>
